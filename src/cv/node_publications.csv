001,Modeling short visual events through the BOLD moments video fMRI dataset and metadata,"Benjamin Lahner, Kshitij Dwivedi, Polina Iamshchinina, Monika Graumann, Alex Lascelles, Gemma Roig, Alessandro Thomas Gifford, Bowen Pan, SouYoung Jin, N. Apurva Ratan Murty, Kendrick Kay, Aude Oliva & Radoslaw Cichy","Studying the neural basis of human dynamic visual perception requires extensive experimental data to evaluate the large swathes of functionally diverse brain neural networks driven by perceiving visual events. Here, we introduce the BOLD Moments Dataset (BMD), a repository of whole-brain fMRI responses to over 1000 short (3 s) naturalistic video clips of visual events across ten human subjects. We use the videos’ extensive metadata to show how the brain represents word- and sentence-level descriptions of visual events and identify correlates of video memorability scores extending into the parietal cortex. Furthermore, we reveal a match in hierarchical processing between cortical regions of interest and video-computable deep neural networks, and we showcase that BMD successfully captures temporal dynamics of visual events at second resolution. With its rich metadata, BMD offers new perspectives and accelerates research on the human brain basis of visual event perception.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50310-3
002,Brain Netflix: Scaling Data to Reconstruct Videos from Brain Signals,"Camilo Fosco*, Benjamin Lahner*, Bowen Pan, Alex Andonian, EmilieJosephs, Alex Lascelles, and Aude Oliva","The field of brain-to-stimuli reconstruction has seen significant progress in the last few years, but techniques continue to be subjectspecific and are usually tested on a single dataset. In this work, we present a novel technique to reconstruct videos from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals designed for performance across datasets and across human participants. Our pipeline accurately generates 2 and 3-second video clips from brain activity coming from distinct participants and different datasets by leveraging multi-dataset and multi-subject training. This helps us regress key latent and conditioning vectors for pretrained text-to-video and video-to-video models to reconstruct accurate videos that match the original stimuli observed by the participant. Key to our pipeline is the introduction of a 3-stage approach that first aligns fMRI signals to semantic embeddings, then regresses important vectors, and finally generates videos with those estimations. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art reconstruction capabilities verified by qualitative and quantitative analyses, including crowd-sourced human evaluation. We showcase performance improvements across two datasets, as well as in multi-subject setups. Our ablation studies shed light on how different alignment strategies and data scaling decisions impact reconstruction performance, and we hint at a future for zero-shot reconstruction by analyzing how performance evolves as more subject data is leveraged.",https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2024/papers_ECCV/papers/03816.pdf
